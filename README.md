# Output Words From File, But Reversed

The script flipwords.py allows you to input a text file, and it will output the words in order of appearance, but reversed.  It can serve as a library to be imported as well.  

## Run Application

In the directory where the script is stored run:

```
python flipwords.py SomeFile.txt
```

If running properly you should see the contents of the text file output to the screen, with all the words reversed in place.
